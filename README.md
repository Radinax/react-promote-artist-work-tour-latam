# PRESENTATION SITE MADE WITH REACT TO PROMOTE ARTISTS

This work was requested in 2019 to promote the work of a celebrity duo on their tour in LATAM, it has a Header, Banner, Youtube Player, Social Media Box, Ads, Sponsors and a Footer.

The idea of this was when they were in a specific country, let's say Argentina, then the site would change the YouTube code, Banner and sponsors, to show Argentina specific data, and this was a constant for every country they visited.

It was made with React and Rebass.
